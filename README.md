- Code was passed through the Pep8 Python validator and 
reported no issues
- Tested in my local terminal and the code institute Heroku terminal

My project was deployed using Code Institue's mock terminal for Heroku 

The following steps were taken to deploy this.

1. Clone this Repository 
2. Create Heroku App
3. Adjust buildbacks to Python and NodeJS - specifically in this order.
4. Bond the Heroku app to the respository
